I like to explore unity game developing stuff, since unity uses c#, so here are the resources I collect to help those who want to learn c#

This is c# basic like 

```
 public int a = 5;
 
 Debug.Log(a);
 ```
 
 It will out put 5 in console window.
 
 The above is very basic syntax, if you want to learn more, please check the [c# basic]: https://github.com/Dokidok1/new1000/blob/master/md_files/c%23_basic.md lecture I wrote !
