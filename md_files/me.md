I like to explore unity game developing stuff, since unity uses c#, so here are the resources I collect to help those who want to learn c#

This is c# basic like 

```c#

using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text.RegularExpressions;

namespace Rextester
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        { public int a = 5;
 
 Debug.Log(a);
        }
    }
}

 ```
 
 It will out put **5** in console window.
 
 The above is very basic syntax, if you want to learn more, please check the 
 [c# basic](https://github.com/Dokidok1/new1000/blob/master/md_files/c%23_basic.md) lecture I wrote !
